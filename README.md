# hjk

**hjk** is a simple yet flexible build tool for Scala and virtually any other language.

hjk is designed with the following principles in mind:

* **Nothing is hardcoded** - everything in hjk is configuration, built-in tasks are just statically served templates (we call them blueprints)
* **Nothing is special** - every single bit of configuration can be overridden by the user, hjk is not opinionated about anything
* **Extensibility gives the power** - hjk is designed to be extensible, you can add support for any reasonable tool with a few lines
